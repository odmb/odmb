	<h1> ME1/1 upgrade</h1>
	<p>Replacement of the current cathode front-end boards is proposed for Phase 1 by
	  “digital” DCFEB boards that flash-digitize every channel rather than using a custom
	  analog storage pipeline (SCA chips). The smaller size of the DCFEB boards should
	  allow us to place seven of these boards on each ME1/1 chamber, and thereby recover
	  muon trigger capability in the rapidity range 2.1 to 2.4. In order to read out the
	  new DCFEB optical links, their trigger and readout boards (TMB and DMB) will need
	  revision. The CFEB, TMB, and DMB cards currently operating on ME1/1 chambers will be
	  recycled by moving them to the lower-rate ME4/2 chambers.</p>
	
	<p>It is proposed to upgrade the Muon Port Cards with high speed optical links and
	  FPGAs, since they are currently the major CSC trigger data bottleneck, allowing only
	  three muon stubs to be transmitted per crossing per 60-degree trigger sector. The
	  Muon Port Cards send their data over optical links to the CSC Track Finder’s Sector
	  Processor cards, so they should be upgraded at the same time, i.e. for Phase 1
	  (described in the TriDas section of this proposal).</p>
	
	<p>It is proposed to upgrade the ALCT mezzanine cards for Phase 1. These cards are the
	  largest source of deadtime to the entire CMS experiment caused by periodic resets of
	  neutron single-event upsets (SEUs). Moreover, the position resolution of the ALCT
	  trigger can be greatly improved to match the η resolution given by the Phase 1 pixel
	  trigger upgrade (described in the TriDas section of this proposal), and significantly
	  better time resolution can be achieved in order to implement a “slow muon” type
	  trigger for heavy stable charged particles.</p>  <br /><br />
