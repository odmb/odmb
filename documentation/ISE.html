	<h1>General ISE Info</h1>
	<p>Our FPGA is a Virtex-6 FPGA provided by Xlinx. Xilinx also
	provides ISE 12.3, the software used to communicate with the
	FPGA. <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/design-tools/v12_3.html">ISE
	12.3 can be downloaded</a> for free, but is over 3GB to
	download and occupies over 12GB installed. Further, it
	requires a license to use.</p>

	<h1>Creating a New Firmware Project</h1>
	<ol>
	  <li>Open ISE.</li>
	  <li>Click "new project."</li>
	  <li>Give te project a name and useful description. In the
	  practice example done on April 4, 2013, the project name was
	  ODMBArmy, for example.</li>
	  <li>Make sure "HDL" is selected. HDL is a category of
	  languages used to design hardware (contrast with schematic
	  capture). VHDL and Verilog are types of HDL. We will always
	  use HDL.</li>
	  <li>Select the device whose name contains "130T". This part
	  of the name tells the size of the device.</li>
	  <li>Check that "family" is set to Virtex-6. This is the FPGA
	  that we have.</li>
	  <li>Set package to 1156. This is the number of pins on our
	  FPGA.</li>
	  <li>Under speed, select the slowest (-1).</li>
	  <li>Once the above selections have been made, click ok to
	  close the pop-up window.</li>
	  <li>The FPGA should appear near the upper left part of the
	  window. Right-click on it and pick "new source." On the menu
	  that appears, select "VHDL module" and name it (in the April
	  4 example, we named this ODMB_top). We could define ports
	  here, but we will eventually need to create another file
	  that specifies which pins connect to which VHDL
	  variables.</li>
	  <li>The file just created contains both an entity (which
	  defines the inputs and outputs) and an architecture.</li>
	  <li>Add a port to the entity ODMB_top so we can declare some
	  inputs and outputs. For example "LEGS : out..." will declare
	  output LEDs and "PB : in..." will declare a push-button
	  input.</li>
	  <li>We still need to add a new source to specify which pins
	  are connected to the 12 LEDs. We do this by clicking the new
	  source button near the upper right of the window. We want an
	  "Implementation Constraints" file, which will have the file
	  extension ".ucf." See, for example, ODMB_pinout.ucf in
	  Manuel's UserCode directory.</li>
	  <li>Now, to compile the code, look at the "processes"
	  subwindow and click on "generate programming file." This
	  will automatically run through the steps of synthesizing,
	  translating, mapping, and then placing and routing. We could
	  do these steps individually, but typically will not. The
	  exception is that is we only want to check whether we've
	  written valid code, we can just use "synthesize."</li>
	  <li>Load the file by going to the "tools" menu and picking
	  "impact." At this point, we can do several things. First, do
	  a boundary scan, right click, and pick initialize. When
	  prompted, select the appropriate ".bit" file. You will also
	  be prompted to attach to a PROM (programmable read-only
	  memory), which can store the program even after shutdown. To
	  do this, we would need an "mcs" file that we have not yet
	  created. This file would configue the PROM and is permanent,
	  but is also slower. For now, do not add a PROM.</li>
	  <li>Finally, select the PROM to see available options and
	  choose a program.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Miscellaneous Trivia</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>Note that in VHDL, '0' denotes low voltage (in our case, 0 V) and '1' denotes high voltage (2.5 V). They do <em>not</em> indicate off and on.</li>
	  <li>Minimum voltage for an LED to turn on is about 0.6 V. An LED also typically requires 5-10 mV of current.</li>
	</ul>
